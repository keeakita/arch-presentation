# Overview

## What is Arch Linux?

*Arch Linux* is "a lightweight and flexible LinuxÂ® distribution that tries to
Keep It Simple."

## Guiding Principles
- *simple* - Packages made available to Arch have few modifications from
  upstream
- *modern* - Packages stay up to date and aim for the most recent stable version
- *pragmatic* - Arch aims to favor practical arguments and developer consensus
  over ideological concerns
    - Arch Linux repositories contain nonfree software, for an alternative see
      [Parabola GNU/Linux-libre](https://www.parabola.nu/)

## Guiding Principles
- *user centric* - Arch is largely driven by its own userbase rather than
  attempting to appeal to as many people as possible
- *versatile* - Arch lets you make choices about how to build your system from
  the ground up
