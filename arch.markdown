# Overview

## What is Arch Linux?

*Arch Linux* is "a lightweight and flexible LinuxÂ® distribution that tries to
Keep It Simple."

## Guiding Principles
- *simple* - Packages made available to Arch have few modifications from
  upstream
- *modern* - Packages stay up to date and aim for the most recent stable version
- *pragmatic* - Arch aims to favor practical arguments and developer consensus
  over ideological concerns
    - Arch Linux repositories contain nonfree software, for an alternative see
      [Parabola GNU/Linux-libre](https://www.parabola.nu/)

## Guiding Principles
- *user centric* - Arch is largely driven by its own userbase rather than
  attempting to appeal to as many people as possible
- *versatile* - Arch lets you make choices about how to build your system from
  the ground up

## Why Arch?
- Packages are updated frequently, you get new features soon after they come out
- Arch lets you build a system tailored to your needs
- Access to a large number of third party packages from the Arch User Repository
    - Arch makes it easy to package software with `mkpkg` and `pacman`
- A great learning experience for seeing what makes a Linux distro tick
- The [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) has pretty good documentation

## Why Not Arch?
- Frequent updates mean things break sometimes
- Frequent updates mean lots of downloading
- It takes some work
- You aren't comfortable with the command line or text editing
- You hate systemd

## A Note About Gentoo
Lots of people draw comparisons between Arch Linux and Gentoo Linux. While they
both have a very similar built-from-the-ground-up approach, Gentoo focuses far
more on user choice and control (choice of init system, USE flags) and is source
based. Arch is binary based and chooses systemd.
