# Overview

## What is Arch Linux?

*Arch Linux* is "a lightweight and flexible LinuxÂ® distribution that tries to
Keep It Simple."

## Guiding Principles
- *simple* - Packages made available to Arch have few modifications from
  upstream
- *modern* - Packages stay up to date and aim for the most recent stable version
- *pragmatic* - Arch aims to favor practical arguments and developer consensus
  over ideological concerns
    - Arch Linux repositories contain nonfree software, for an alternative see
      [Parabola GNU/Linux-libre](https://www.parabola.nu/)

## Guiding Principles
- *user centric* - Arch is largely driven by its own userbase rather than
  attempting to appeal to as many people as possible
- *versatile* - Arch lets you make choices about how to build your system from
  the ground up

## Why Arch?
- Packages are updated frequently, you get new features soon after they come out
- Arch lets you build a system tailored to your needs
- Access to a large number of third party packages from the Arch User Repository
    - Arch makes it easy to package software with `mkpkg` and `pacman`
- A great learning experience for seeing what makes a Linux distro tick
- The [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) has pretty good documentation

## Why Not Arch?
- Frequent updates mean things break sometimes
- Frequent updates mean lots of downloading
- It takes some work
- You aren't comfortable with the command line or text editing
- You hate systemd

## A Note About Gentoo
Lots of people draw comparisons between Arch Linux and Gentoo Linux. While they
both have a very similar built-from-the-ground-up approach, Gentoo focuses far
more on user choice and control (choice of init system, USE flags) and is source
based. Arch is binary based and chooses systemd.

# Installing Arch

## Following Along

If you plan on installing yourself, I highly recommend reading the [Arch Wiki's
Beginner guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners'_guide). Most of
the content from the following slides comes from this page.

## Ways to Install

There are plenty of different ways to install Arch, including
- Via a disk
- Via a flash drive
- Over the network
- From an existing Linux Distribution

This talk will mostly be covering the first two, but there's a lot of overlap in
steps. Check the Arch Wiki.

## Downloading the installer

Arch Linux is *rolling-release*.
- It has no official version number and releases packages as they updates are
  available
- Compare this to Ubuntu, which releases a new version every 6 months

You can download a snapshot of the Arch installer image (generated monthly) from
https://archlinux.org/download/.

## Preparing the image

Use your favorite disk burning program to burn to disk, or with a USB stick:

    sudo dd if=archlinux-2016.01.01-dual.iso \
      of=/dev/your-flashdrive
    sync

*NOTE:* Be **VERY CAREFUL** when making sure you're writing to the flash drive
and not some other disk.

## Booting into the installer

If you have a UEFI computer (Windows 8 or 10), you will need to disable
SecureBoot. This has probably already been done by you if you've installed Linux
on the machine before. Instructions vary by machine.

Insert the disk or flash drive and boot into it. This also varies by machine for
no good reason.

## Connect to the internet

Arch downloads a fresh set of packages from the internet, so you'll need to be
connected
